# calculator
This is the third and the last project in a series of JavaScript Basics projects from The Odin Project curriculum.

Features I'll definitely implement in the future:
* ~~percentage calculation~~
* exponentation operator
* parentheses combined with expressions
* proper operator precedence

Features I might implement sometime (not my highest priority):
* remainder operator
* special button for Pi number
